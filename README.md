 Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandam1/breastcancerdataset

The dataset contains information on over 400 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery for the treatment of breast cancer. Below is the information for all columns in the dataset:

- Patient_ID: ID of the patient
- Age: Age of the patient
- Gender: Gender of the patient
- Protein 1, Protein 2, Protein 3, and Protein 4: expression levels
- Tumor_Stage: breast cancer stage of the patient
- Histology: Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, Infiltration Lobular Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma
- ER status: positive or negative
- PR status: Positive/Negative
- HER2 status: positive or negative
- Surgery_type: Lumpectomy, Simple Mastectomy, Modified Radical Mastectomy, Other
- DateofSurgery: The date of surgery
- DateofLast_Visit: The date of the last visit of the patient.
- Patient_Status: Alive/Dead

# Task
